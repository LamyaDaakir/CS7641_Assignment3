For this assignment, I used Jyputer. There is 2 Jupyter notebooks and 2 csv files.

The Jyputer notebooks and CSV datasets are located at the following URL:

https://github.com/LamyaDaakir/CS7641_Assignment3

Dataset #1 files:
    ionosphere.ipynb
    ionosphere.csv
    seismic.ipynb
    seismic.csv

To run the code, download the files into a directory and execute the 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' command.
Open the appropriate notebook and run the cells starting from the top.
